# ICS Colors

To include ICS theme variables along with all ICS global and component styles, import this stylesheet:

```scss
@import 'carbon-addons-ics/scss/index-themed.scss';
```

If you'd like to use our components and styles with another theme, or to use it with Carbon's default theme variables:

```scss
@import 'carbon-addons-ics/scss/index.scss';
```
