### Usage

```js
import { Loading } from 'carbon-addons-ics';
```

### About

Loading spinners are used when retrieving data or performing slow computations, and help to notify users that loading is underway.

The 'active' property is true by default; set to false to end the animation.

Be sure to set either large as the default is small.
