### About

An avatar is a graphical representation of a user and typically appears in list and card views, along side a user's information and/or content that they have created. Users have the ability to upload pictures for their avatar but until they do so they are provided with a default avatar. 

Images provided to the Avatar component should be square shaped, having an equal height and width.
